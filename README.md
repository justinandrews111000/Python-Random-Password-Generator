Python Random Password Generator written python 3.12.2

This is a simple password generator with a GUI using tkinter. It prevents you from generating a password until you make the random seed by clicking the 'Generate seed' button and clickng all of the buttons displayed on the second window. The seed is generated by getting the current time the user clicks the boxes and processes them into workable data that is averaged out and used as a multiplier on a hash created from a pseudo-random number generated by random.randint. I'm not sure how technically secure this is. Once the seed is generated, the user can then use a scale to selected the length of the password (12 - 32 characters) with addition checkboxes to include letters and symbols into the password.

To run it you can download the .exe file, load it into an IDE with a python environment, or run the commands:

cd "directory file saved to"
python PasswordGenerator.py 

Packaged to .exe using Auto Py To Exe
I created the .ICO using InkScape
